<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

React app made for demo purposes. Blog style app that consists of 3 pages/routes. Focused on state managment using ContextAPI. Node.js & npm are required.

Basic structure:

-   Modified [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/)
-   State managed with ContextAPI (Redux/Thunk with Reselect is also included and wrapped, so you can use that)
-   Function based React, knowledge of Hooks is required
-   Grid system based on Bootstrap framework
-   Normalize copied from Bootstrap
-   Custom src structure
-   Prop-types for typing
-   All components made from scratch
-   CamelCase convention
-   [LoremPicsum](https://picsum.photos/) API used for Blog images
-   [my-json-server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/markoarthofer22/q-agency-db) for storing default data (in free ver. it doesn't support saves beetween
    API calls)

### Built With

-   [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/)
-   [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

First, to discuss structure and typing in app.

-   files are sorted per usage. (alphabetically)
    -   /assets => imported assets that get compiled (backgrounds ect.)
    -   /components => reusable componets, can be shared on other projects :smile:
    -   /contextStore => ContextAPI store, contains globals and app folder, for state managment (used in this project)
    -   /css => global styles (app.scss, libs, grid), variables.scss (all vars are defined and shared in it)
    -   /layouts => grouped components that make a whole. Can be reused together (example SingleBlogCard)
    -   /pages => main pages for router
    -   /redux => store for state managment based on Redux/Thunk/Reselect, wrapped around App.js (usable)
    -   /routes => routes.js file, plain js object that contains routes (I like to keep it seperated :smile: )
-   .scss is used per component. every component/page/layout has its own styles.scss
-   App.js => first component rendered, used as wrapper for Context (Providers) and for GlobalLoader
-   Index.js => main components, used as wrapper for Redux store
